# DS4H
Decentralized Solutions for Humanity (DS4H) is a blockchain research network.
We aim a sustainable blockchain network which hosts decentralized solutions for humanity.
Our hosts are located in four different cities (regions) of Anatolia. We also want to extend the nodes, please be in contact.
